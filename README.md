Each script here is labeled with a description on what the code does at the top of the script.
Throughout the code you'll find tiny comments explaining what specific things do.

I apologize in advance for GitHub formatting the indents weirdly. They don't show up in studio that way, so rest assured!

Thank you for reading.
